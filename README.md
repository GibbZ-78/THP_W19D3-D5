# LE BON CLIOOP

## Trying to have fun mixing Ruby CLI (:see_no_evil:) with OOP (:speak_no_evil:) and e-Business (:hear_no_evil:)

### :scroll: Content

<hr>

This repository stores my (incomplete) deliverables relating to a last minute POO practical exam that popped-up on week #19 of the "Developer" curriculum, a 3-month web coding bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (THP, [https://www.thehackingproject.org/](https://www.thehackingproject.org/)).  
This exercise consists, based on iteratively shared evolutive specs, in coding an Xterm Ruby program simulating a small shop management system:

- Stock of items stored in a CSV file
- 2-part shop enabling administration on one side, catalog browsing and purchasing as a customer on the other side
- CRUD over items for authorized personel on one side, stock management and selling process simulation on the other side
- Etc.

### :bulb: How to

<hr>

1. Clone the current :octocat: repository to your local :computer: using something as simple as `git clone git@github.com:GibbZ-78/THP_W19D3-D5.git <my_target_local_directory>`
2. Move to the just-brought-in directory by typing `cd <my_target_local_directory> [RETURN]`
3. First make sure to install all basic gems and related dependancies via the `bundle install [RETURN]` command
4. Finally launch the program entering `ruby app.rb [RETURN]`
5. Now enjoy this _React side of life_

_Notice :one:: if you feel adventurous, at one point, you might need a password... Try `1234` and Enjoy :wink:  
Notice :two:: if you ever wanted to know what "guidance" or "specs" this ugly results comes from, have a look at the bundled [Guidelines.md](https://github.com/GibbZ-78/THP_W19D3-D5/blob/main/Guidelines.md)_

### :books: Alternate Resources

<hr>

Because the one provided by THP was not so comprehensive, readable and clear, I advise you to have a look at these contents instead to be sure to embrace OOP (with Ruby) more gracefully and painlessly, among other topics (such as _File Management_):

### :computer: Development Environment

<hr>
- Ubuntu 20.04 hosted by WSL 2 running on Windows 10 Famille (version 21H1 build 19043.1645)
- Ruby 2.7.4
- And that's pretty it... We're talking about a simple CLI program, boy!
